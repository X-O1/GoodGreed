# GOODGREED: Fund Public Goods With the Trading Fees of Others

## Overview
GOODGREED transforms speculative trading into a powerful tool for funding public goods, charities, and personal causes. By redirecting a portion of token trading fees to verified causes, GOODGREED ensures that market activity generates sustainable, impactful revenue. Every project launched on the platform is tied to a verified identity, ensuring authenticity and accountability.

## Key Features

### 1. **Greed Meets Good**
GOODGREED aligns profit-seeking with philanthropy by redirecting trading fees to meaningful causes. Traders benefit from market speculation, while causes gain a continuous revenue stream.

### 2. **Verified Launches**
Only verified accounts on X (formerly Twitter) can launch tokens, tying real-world reputations to each project. This reduces spam and ensures accountability.

### 3. **Locked Liquidity**
Liquidity is locked upon token launch, protecting investors from rug pulls and boosting confidence.

### 4. **Automated Deployment**
A bot automates token deployment by validating posts tagging the official GOODGREED account. This minimizes human error and streamlines the launch process.

### 5. **Time-Locked Security**
A 12–24 hour delay between posting and token launch ensures security against hacks and provides time for thoughtful preparation.

### 6. **Fee Flow**
A portion of every trade (e.g., 1%) is routed to the cause’s wallet, creating a sustainable funding mechanism without the need for founders to sell tokens.

### 7. **Reputation-Driven Accountability**
With verified identities tied to each launch, founders are incentivized to maintain credibility and avoid misuse of funds.

## How It Works

1. **Set Up on GOODGREED**  
   Connect your wallet, input token details (name, ticker, bio, etc.), and specify your verified X handle.

2. **Post on X**  
   Announce your cause by tagging the official GOODGREED account with your wallet address. The bot validates your identity and initiates a launch countdown.

3. **Token Launch**  
   After the countdown, liquidity is automatically provided and locked. Trading begins, and a fraction of trading fees flows to the cause’s wallet.

4. **Collect Fees**  
   Causes receive accumulated fees from trading activity, which can be withdrawn according to the vesting schedule.

## Game Theory & Market Dynamics

- **Market “Voting”**: Projects with compelling missions attract more trading activity, driving higher fee revenue.
- **Win-Win Model**: Traders can speculate on price, while causes gain continuous funding.
- **Reputation-Driven**: Publicly tying a verified identity to a project encourages transparency and accountability.

## Why GOODGREED?

GOODGREED is more than a token launchpad; it’s a new way to fund public goods and personal causes. By combining verified identities, DeFi automation, and locked liquidity, GOODGREED fosters a trust-minimized ecosystem where traders and causes mutually benefit.
